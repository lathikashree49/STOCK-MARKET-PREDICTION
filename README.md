# STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION
The Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression project aims to forecast future stock prices based on historical closing price data. Using a simple yet effective supervised learning algorithm—Linear Regression—this project demonstrates how past stock performance can help estimate near-term future trends. The data is preprocessed and visualized to understand trends, and then split into training and testing sets to build and evaluate the model. This model helps investors and analysts gain insights into price movements, allowing them to make more informed financial decisions.

The model is trained to predict the closing price of a stock for the next few days (e.g., 5-day forecast) using only its past closing prices. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score are used to measure its performance. While Linear Regression is a basic model, this project lays the foundation for understanding how stock forecasting works and can be extended further using more complex algorithms like LSTM, ARIMA, or ensemble models. The project is implemented using Python in a Jupyter Notebook and is ideal for beginners exploring financial data analytics and machine learning.
